# How to filter or sort an OpenAPI file.

> [!TIP]
> In previous versions of Kubb we used `openapi-format` internally but with v3 this has been removed.

We recommend using [openapi-format](https://github.com/thim81/openapi-format) to filter out some operations or paths. Ordering fields, format the casing(pascalcase, camelcase) of component elements and so much more.
